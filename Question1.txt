Question 1:

a).
	- Initial counters to 0.
	- Increment counter by one whenever a new page is add to the a frame.
	- Decrement counter by one when the page is no longer needs to be on a frame.
	- A new page will be replacing a page on a frame with lowest counter.

b). For four frame with this algorithm there will be 14 page faults.

c). The minimum number of page fault for an optimal page replacement strategy for the

	reference string in part b would be 11 page faults.
